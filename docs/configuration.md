# Configuration

Baron's configuration is one committed file — `.baron/policy.json` — plus credentials that live
outside it. `baron init` writes the policy for you; this page documents what it contains so you can
read and hand-edit it.

## `.baron/policy.json`

Policy only — **never secrets**. A full example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "providers": {
    "issues": "azure-devops",
    "scm": "azure-devops",
    "ci": "azure-devops",
    "deploy": "azure-devops",
    "notify": "slack"
  },
  "roleMap": {
    "azure-devops": {
      "stateKey": "state",
      "states": {
        "backlog": { "state": "New" },
        "in_progress": { "state": "Active", "boardColumn": "In Progress" },
        "in_review": { "state": "Test", "boardColumn": "Test" },
        "done": { "state": "Closed" }
      }
    }
  },
  "typeMap": {
    "azure-devops": { "epic": "Epic", "story": "Product Backlog Item", "task": "Task" }
  },
  "gapPolicy": {
    "github": { "hierarchy": "emulate:labels", "sprints": "degrade" }
  },
  "language": { "interaction": "en", "artifacts": "en" }
}
```

### Fields

- **`version`** — schema version (currently `1`).
- **`providers`** — binds each port to a provider id: `issues`, `scm`, `ci`, `deploy`, `notify`,
  `docs`. A port you don't bind simply isn't available. `ci` and `deploy` reuse the
  `issues`/`scm` credentials and coordinates — no extra env keys and no `baron init` step, because
  their status maps are vendor-fixed adapter knowledge, not user-confirmed. Binding `docs` is not yet
  supported (v2) and throws `DOCS_UNSUPPORTED`.
- **`roleMap`** — keyed by provider id. Each entry has a `stateKey` (which native target key the
  reverse role lookup is keyed on — Azure `state`, GitHub `label`) and `states`: a map of workflow
  role → native target (a flat string map, e.g. `{ "state": "Active", "boardColumn": "In Progress" }`
  or `{ "label": "in-progress" }`).
- **`typeMap`** — keyed by provider id: type role → native work-item type name. A provider with one
  native type (GitHub) maps every role onto it (reverse resolution is lossy — noted by `init`).
- **`gapPolicy`** *(optional)* — keyed by provider id: capability name → behavior string
  (`error` | `degrade` | `emulate:<strategy>`). Absent ⇒ `error` (strict). See
  [Concepts → capability gaps](./concepts.md#3-capability-gaps-are-never-silent).
- **`language`** *(optional)* — `interaction` (prompts) and `artifacts` (committed text) languages.

A malformed or structurally-invalid policy fails loudly with a coded `POLICY_PARSE` /
`ROLE_MAP_MISSING` / … error — never a silent default.

> **Note:** link-type→native mapping (`relates` → `System.LinkTypes.Related`, …) is *fixed provider
> knowledge*, not install config, so it's supplied by the adapter and not part of `policy.json`.

## Credentials

Credentials never live in `policy.json`. The CLI and MCP server read them from the environment,
overlaid by a gitignored `.baron/credentials` file (`KEY=VALUE` lines; `#` comments allowed) when
present — a real environment variable wins over the file. `baron init` scaffolds
`.baron/credentials.example` and gitignores the real file.

| Provider | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Azure DevOps | `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG`, `AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT`, `AZURE_DEVOPS_REPO` (scm), `AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN` |
| GitHub | `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Slack (notify) | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_CHANNEL` |

Example `.baron/credentials` (never committed):

```
AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=beekod
AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT=BeeMaster
AZURE_DEVOPS_REPO=BeeMaster
AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN=<your-pat>
```

## One target per install (and how to do "multi")

A single `.baron/policy.json` (in one workspace) targets **one** Azure DevOps org/project (issues) +
**one** repo (scm), because the coordinates come from that workspace's environment. To work across
many projects today, give each repo/workspace its own `.baron/policy.json` and credentials — Baron
is workspace-scoped, so this just works.

> Roadmap: org/project/repo are coordinates, not secrets (they're already in your git remote), so a
> planned refinement moves them into `policy.json` and keeps only the token in the environment —
> making a policy fully self-describing and easing multi-target setups. Single-process multi-tenancy
> (one server driving N orgs) is a larger, later feature.

## `baron doctor`

`doctor` re-introspects the live provider and reports drift between the policy and reality (a mapped
native state / type / board column that no longer exists). Run it after a provider's process
template changes. Label-discriminated providers (GitHub) skip native-state checks (labels are
Baron-managed).

## Signing in instead of pasting a token (GitHub)

`baron init` can take you through GitHub's **device flow** rather than asking you to assemble a
fine-grained token by hand: it prints a short code, you approve it in a browser, and the token comes
back with the permissions the app was granted. No client secret is involved, which is precisely why a
local CLI can do it — the same mechanism `gh` uses.

It is offered when an app id is configured:

```
BARON_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23li...      # an OAuth App or GitHub App client id — public by design
BARON_GITHUB_SCOPE=repo               # optional; OAuth Apps only, GitHub Apps ignore it
```

Someone has to register that app once — Baron ships no client id of its own, because an id baked
into an open-source CLI is an id anyone can put their own name behind.

**It is offered, not forced.** A fine-grained PAT is narrower than any scope an OAuth App can
request (`repo` is the smallest single scope covering issues, contents and pull requests), so an
install that wants the tighter credential should not have to fight the friendlier path to get it.
Either way `baron doctor` verifies what the credential can actually do before you start work.
